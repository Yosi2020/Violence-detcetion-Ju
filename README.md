# Violence-detcetion-Ju

This project is done at Jimma University in 2021EC for our mini/semester project. As we know now a day the violence is occurring in Ethiopia in different areas, due to this reason, we try to solve our community and government problems using artificial intelligence (AI) using both Fine-tuning using VGG-16, motion detection using Cnn+BiLstm, and using VGG-16 to differentiate the accuracy and to get the best solution. Finally to get the full 62 page documation of this project please contact me using @LindaAug1 on my own telegram and through my email using eyosimar524@gmail.com        

download and use code before that make create a folder with name "my_lib" and put mailer.py, thead.py, and confg.py


This system is done on both feature extracting using VGG16+GRU and finetuning using VGG16, we get an accurcay of 94% and 99% respectively.


Finally i would like to say thanks MR. Gadisa W for the guidance, inspiration and constructive suggestions that helps us in the preparation of this project and also he helped us how to prepare the documentation.
